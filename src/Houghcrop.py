    """
    Uses Hough Circle Transform to detect circular features (e.g., cornea or pupil) and crops the image around the detected circle.

    Parameters:
        filename (str): Name of the image file (e.g. 'image01.jpg').
        input_folder (str): Folder where preprocessed (CLAHE or grayscale) images are stored.
        dp (float): Inverse ratio of accumulator resolution to image resolution (usually 1.0â€“2.0).
        minDist (int): Minimum distance between detected circles.
        param1 (int): Higher threshold for Canny edge detector (lower is half this).
        param2 (int): Accumulator threshold for circle detection (lower = more circles).
        minRadius (int): Minimum radius of circles to detect.
        maxRadius (int): Maximum radius of circles to detect.
        output_size (tuple): Final size of the cropped and resized image.

    Returns:
        final_img (np.ndarray): Cropped and resized image centered on detected circle.
        filename (str): Original filename (for saving/logging downstream).
